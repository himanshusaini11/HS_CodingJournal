# HS Coding Journal

Welcome to the **HS Coding Journal** repository! This project serves as a comprehensive coding journal to document and track coding challenges, solutions, and learning progress over time.

## Project Overview

The HS Coding Journal is a web application built using Dash and Flask that allows users to explore different model evaluation techniques in simple linear regression. Users can generate datasets, select model validation techniques, and visualize regression lines and Mean Squared Error (MSE) plots.

## Features

- **Generate Dataset**: Create custom datasets by specifying the number of samples and noise level.
- **Model Validation Techniques**: Choose from Train/Test on the same dataset, Train/Test Split, or K-Fold Cross-Validation.
- **Visualization**: Plot regression lines and MSE vs. K-Fold plots to analyze model performance.

## Installation

To get started with the HS Coding Journal, you can clone the repository to your local machine.

### Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Dash
- Flask
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

### Installation Steps

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/himanshusaini11/HS_CodingJournal.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd HS_CodingJournal
    ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Run the application:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
2. Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:8000`.

3. Use the web interface to:
   - Generate datasets by specifying the number of samples and noise level.
   - Select a model validation technique (Train/Test on the same dataset, Train/Test Split, or K-Fold Cross-Validation).
   - Visualize the regression line and MSE plots.
